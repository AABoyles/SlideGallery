============

A Barebones platform to show a scrollable image gallery

WHY
---
I noticed today that, annoyingly, none of my Windows image viewers could view 
my collection of cinegraphs--they would display the first frame as a static 
image.  So, I resolved to build the simplest possible viewer to fix that 
problem.  30 miuntes of Javascript, HTML, and PHP later and here you go!

SlideGallery uses Reveal.js to handle all the complicated, slideshow stuff.

To make a SlideGallery, put all your images into the images/ directory of this 
repo and deploy it to any PHP server.
